# Chapter 02, Exercise 02

Consider the following program:  
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its compleition.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.  
(b) What output does the program produces?  

The program has one directive in line 1 and four statements in lines 5-8.  
The output is:  

```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
```
